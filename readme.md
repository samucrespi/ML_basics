## Lesson 1 - Linear Regression Single Variable

In the first lesson we are going to write python code to predict home prices using a machine learning technique called *simple linear regression*.

## Lesson 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression

In the second lesson we are going to look into linear regression with multiple variables, also known as *multivariate regression*.

## Lesson 3 - Gradient Descent

In this third lesson we are going to cover some of the important concepts, specifically: mean square error, cost function, gradient descent, and learning rate.

## Lesson 4 - Save Model Using Joblib And Pickle

In this fourth lesson we look into two different approaches of saving a trained model to a file, which you can use later on to load the model from a file into memory and use that to make actual predictions.
The two storing approaches are "pickle" and "joblib". Examples can be found in "Lesson_01/Linear_Regression.ipynb".
