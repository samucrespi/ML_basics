## Lesson 1 - Linear Regression Single Variable

In the first lesson we are going to write python code to predict home prices using a machine learning technique called *simple linear regression*.

## Lesson 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression

In the second lesson we are going to look into linear regression with multiple variables, also known as *multivariate regression*.

## Lesson 3 - Gradient Descent

In this third lesson we are going to cover some of the important concepts, specifically: mean square error, cost function, gradient descent, and learning rate.

## Lesson 4 - Save Model Using Joblib And Pickle

In this fourth lesson we look into two different approaches of saving a trained model to a file, which you can use later on to load the model from a file into memory and use that to make actual predictions.
The two storing approaches are "pickle" and "joblib". Examples can be found in "Lesson_01/Linear_Regression.ipynb".

## Lesson 5  - Dummy Variables & One Hot Encoding

In this lesson we are going to learn about dummy variables, which are binary variables used in statistical models to represent categorical data, typically represented as 0 or 1.

## Lesson 6  - Train & Test splitting

In this lesson we are going to look into how to split your data set into training and test using sklearn on train test split method.

## Lesson 7a  - Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

In this first part of lesson 7 we are going to cover binary classification through logistic regression which is a method of predicting a binary outcome (such as yes/no) using a logistic function to model the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Lesson 7b  - Logistic Regression - Multiclass Classification

In this second part of lesson 7 we will consider multiclass classification which is a method of predicting an outcome among more than two classes using a set of logistic regression models, where each model predicts the probability of belonging to a particular class.
